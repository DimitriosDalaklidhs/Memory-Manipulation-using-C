#  Memory and Bit Manipulation in C

This project explores **low-level bitwise and memory operations** in C — showing how to directly manipulate data at the binary and byte level.  
It’s a hands-on example of how bit masks, shifting, and pointer arithmetic work together to control data most efficiently.
## Overview
The main program (`memory_manipulation.c`) demonstrates:

 Bitwise flag manipulation (`READ`, `WRITE`, `EXEC`)
Bit setting, clearing, and toggling
Parity (odd/even bit count) using bitwise operations
 Memory allocation with `malloc`, copying with `memcpy`, and inversion with XOR
Masked writes to bytes
 Bit rotation (ROL)
Counting set bits (popcount)
Counting trailing zeros (CTZ)

Each operation includes comments explaining the logic and output.
